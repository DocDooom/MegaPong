# MegaPong
Pong Game for Megadrive/Genesis; A playable ROM is included in the out directory (rom.bin)
This needs an emulator to run (I use Fusion) or can be written to a Cartridge, if you're feeling adventurous 

To compile you'll need to have SGDK installed with environment variables setup. You can get SGDK
